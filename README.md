# Orange

Orange was a project developed over the course of three days for Startup Weekend San Luis Obispo. This was a proof of concept more than a complete application; many parts are static, not fully implemented, and definitely not tested.

This project was also used by several members of our team to learn about web development, ruby, and the rails framework. As such, the codebase isn't as clean as it could be. All in all though, we're proud of the final result, and everyone learned a lot!
